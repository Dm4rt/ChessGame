# ChessGame

This is my Chess project that's a work in progress. Everything was made by me using Java. As such there may be some bugs here and there.

You must have Java installed to play. Simply download and unzip the Chess.zip file. Run the chess.jar file using your console command line or by simply clicking it. Alternatively you can also run the chess.exe file to run the game
